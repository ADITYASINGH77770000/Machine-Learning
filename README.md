**Machine Learning Repository**

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Repository**, a comprehensive collection of resources covering the entire workflow of Machine Learning from scratch. This repository serves as a structured learning path, providing theoretical concepts, hands-on coding examples, and real-world applications.

**📌 Features**
- **Introduction to Machine Learning**: Basics, types of ML (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning), and real-world applications.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical data, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Supervised Learning**: Implementation of Regression and Classification models.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering techniques like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Deep Learning Basics**: Introduction to Neural Networks and TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: Cross-validation, Hyperparameter tuning, and Performance Metrics.
- **ML Deployment**: Exporting models using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit for real-world usage.
- **Case Studies & Projects**: Practical end-to-end projects to reinforce learning.
