Simplify and solve these equations:
\[ y + 2 + \frac{1}{3} = 4y - y - 2 \]
\[ y + \frac{7}{3} = 3y - 2 \]
\[ \frac{7}{3} + 2 = 3y - y \]

synthetic_math,Suppose that $g(x) = 5x - 3$. What is $g^{-1}(g^{-1}(14))$?,"First, we need to find the inverse function $g^{-1}(x)$. Given $g(x) = 5x - 3$, solve for $x$:

Now, apply $g^{-1}$ twice to the given value $14$:
\[ g^{-1}(14) = \frac{14 + 3}{5} = \frac{17}{5} \]

$$
\begin{cases}

$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 1$, which means the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.

2. Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.

3. From $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we get $f(x) > g(x)$, which means $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. If $a > 1$, then
$$

synthetic_math,Compute $\cos 225^\circ$.,"Let $Q$ be the point on the unit circle that corresponds to $225^\circ$ measured counterclockwise from the positive $x$-axis. 

The angle $225^\circ$ is $180^\circ + 45^\circ$, placing $Q$ in the third quadrant of the unit circle. A point in the third quadrant has both negative $x$ and $y$ coordinates. Since the reference angle here (the acute angle with the $x$-axis) is $45^\circ$, we know from symmetry and the properties of $45^\circ-45^\circ-90^\circ$ triangles that the coordinates of $Q$ must be negative versions of those at $45^\circ$, which are $\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$.

$$
\frac{1}{a(1+b)}+\frac{1}{b(1+c)}+\frac{1}{c(1+a)} \geq \frac{3}{1+abc},
$$

and that equality occurs if and only if \( a = b = c = 1 \).","1. Consider the given inequality:

\[
\frac{1}{a(1+b)}+ \frac{1}{b(1+c)}+ \frac{1}{c(1+a)} \geq \frac{3}{1 + abc}
\]

To simplify, we add \( \frac{3}{1 + abc} \) to both sides. The new inequality becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{a(1+b)} + \frac{1}{b(1+c)} + \frac{1}{c(1+a)} + \frac{3}{1 + abc} \geq \frac{6}{1 + abc}
\]

2. Let's analyze each term with an added \( \frac{1}{1 + abc} \):

\[
\frac{1}{a(1+b)} + \frac{1}{1 + abc}, \quad \frac{1}{b(1+c)} + \frac{1}{1 + abc}, \quad \frac{1}{c(1+a)} + \frac{1}{1 + abc}
\]

We can rewrite them as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{a(1+b)} + \frac{1}{1 + abc} &= \frac{1}{1 + abc} \left( \frac{1 + abc}{a(1+b)} + 1 \right), \\
\frac{1}{b(1+c)} + \frac{1}{1 + abc} &= \frac{1}{1 + abc} \left( \frac{1 + abc}{b(1+c)} + 1 \right), \\
\frac{1}{c(1+a)} + \frac{1}{1 + abc} &= \frac{1}{1 + abc} \left( \frac{1 + abc}{c(1+a)} + 1 \right).
\end{aligned}
\]

3. Simplifying inside the parentheses:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1 + abc}{a(1+b)} + 1 &= \frac{1 + abc + a(1+b)}{a(1+b)} = \frac{1 + abc + a + ab}{a(1+b)} = \frac{1 + a + ab + abc}{a(1+b)}, \\
\frac{1 + abc}{b(1+c)} + 1 &= \frac{1 + abc + b(1+c)}{b(1+c)} = \frac{1 + abc + b + bc}{b(1+c)} = \frac{1 + b + bc + abc}{b(1+c)}, \\
\frac{1 + abc}{c(1+a)} + 1 &= \frac{1 + abc + c(1+a)}{c(1+a)} = \frac{1 + abc + c + ac}{c(1+a)} = \frac{1 + c + ac + abc}{c(1+a)}.
\end{aligned}
\]

4. Combining the simplified terms, we get:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{a(1+b)} + \frac{1}{1 + abc} &= \frac{1}{1 + abc} \left( \frac{1 + a + ab + abc}{a(1+b)} \right), \\
\frac{1}{b(1+c)} + \frac{1}{1 + abc} &= \frac{1}{1 + abc} \left( \frac{1 + b + bc + abc}{b(1+c)} \right), \\
\frac{1}{c(1+a)} + \frac{1}{1 + abc} &= \frac{1}{1 + abc} \left( \frac{1 + c + ac + abc}{c(1+a)} \right).
\end{aligned}
\]

5. Adding these terms together:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\left( \frac{1 + a + ab + abc}{a(1+b)} + \frac{1 + b + bc + abc}{b(1+c)} + \frac{1 + c + ac + abc}{c(1+a)} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{1 + abc}
\end{aligned}
\]

Each term inside the parentheses \( \frac{ 1 + x + xy + xyz}{x(1+y)} \) paired as \( x + \frac{1}{x} \). By AM-GM inequality, for any positive \( x \):

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} \geq 2
\]

Therefore, each addition results in at least 2, and since we have three such terms:

\[
\frac{1 + a + ab + abc}{a(1+b)} + \frac{1 + b + bc + abc}{b(1+c)} + \frac{1 + c + ac + abc}{c(1+a)} \geq 6
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{6}{1 + abc}
\]

6. From steps above, we conclude:

\[
\frac{1}{a(1+b)} + \frac{1}{b(1+c)} + \frac{1}{c(1+a)} + \frac{3}{1 + abc} \geq \frac{6}{1 + abc}

This demonstrates that:

\[

1. **Observe the Structure of \( N \)**:
    Let \( N = AB0AB \) and let \( t \) be the two-digit integer \( AB \).

    We recognize that \( N = 1001 \cdot t \), where \( 1001 = 11 \cdot 91 = 11 \cdot 7 \cdot 13 \).

    Thus, 
    \[
    N = t \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13

2. **Formulate the Problem**:
    We need to write \( N \) as the product of 5 distinct odd integers, each greater than 2, and count the possible sets \( S \) of such integers.

    - **Case 1: \( S = \{7, 11, 13, m, n\} \)**:
        - Here, 
        \[
        N = 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \cdot m \cdot n

        \[
        m \cdot n < 100

        Analyzing possible values of \( m \) and corresponding \( n \):

        - If \( m = 5 \), then \( n \) can be \( 9, 15, 17, 19 \) yielding \( mn \) values: \( 45, 75, 85, 95 \).

            - Only \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 5 \) satisfy this condition.
        - \( q \geq 7 \) is invalid.
        
        There are 3 sets in this case.

    - **Case 3: \( S = \{7, 11q, 13, m, n\} \)**, similar constraints apply:
        - If \( q = 3 \), \( mn \leq 33 \) with possibilities:
            - If \( m = 3 \), \( n = 5, 9 \), 2 sets are valid.
        - If \( q = 5 \), only valid option is \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 5 \).
        - \( q \geq 7 \) is invalid.

        There are 3 sets in this case.

    - **Case 4: \( S = \{7, 11, 13 q, m, n\} \)**:

        - Recognize that \( 77 = 7 \cdot 11 \) and set \( mn \leq 99 \) but \( mnr \geq 105 \). No favorable solutions detected.

orca_math,"Tom decides to open a theater. He knows it will cost $5 per square foot of space that he needs and he needs 12 square feet for every seat in his theater. He wants a 500 seat theater. He also realizes construction will cost twice as much as the land. He has a partner who covers a certain percentage of the cost. Tom spends $54,000. What percentage of the cost does his partner cover?","First, let's calculate the total square footage Tom needs for his 500 seat theater:

12 square feet/seat * 500 seats = 6000 square feet

Next, we calculate the cost of the land based on the square footage:

$5/square foot * 6000 square feet = $30,000

Since construction costs twice as much as the land, we calculate the construction cost:

2 * $30,000 = $60,000

Now we have the total cost of the project by adding the land and construction costs:

$30,000 (land) + $60,000 (construction) = $90,000

Tom spends $54,000, so we need to find out how much his partner covers. The partner's contribution plus Tom's contribution should equal the total cost:

Partner's contribution + $54,000 = $90,000

Now we solve for the partner's contribution:

Partner's contribution = $90,000 - $54,000
Partner's contribution = $36,000

To find the percentage the partner covers, we divide the partner's contribution by the total cost and multiply by 100:

olympiads,"Given real numbers \( a, b, c \) and a positive number \( \lambda \) such that the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c \) has three real roots \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \), and the conditions \( x_2 - x_1 = \lambda \) and \( x_3 > \frac{1}{2}(x_1 + x_2) \) are satisfied, find the maximum value of \( \frac{2 a^3 + 27 c - 9 a b}{\lambda^3} \).","
We begin by analyzing the function \( f(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c \), which has three real roots \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \). We are given the following conditions:
1. \( x_2 - x_1 = \lambda \)
2. \( x_3 > \frac{1}{2} (x_1 + x_2) \)

We aim to find the maximum value of \( \frac{2a^3 + 27c - 9ab}{\lambda^3} \).

1. **Transform the polynomial to remove the quadratic term:**
   Substitute \( x = y - \frac{a}{3} \) into \( f(x) \):
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   F(y) & = f\left(y - \frac{a}{3}\right) \\
        & = \left(y - \frac{a}{3}\right)^3 + a \left(y - \frac{a}{3}\right)^2 + b \left(y - \frac{a}{3}\right) + c \\
        & = y^3 - \left(\frac{a^2}{3} - b\right)y + \frac{1}{27}(2a^3 + 27c - 9ab).
   \end{aligned}
   \]

2. **Identify the new roots of \( F(y) \):**
   Let the roots of \( F(y) \) be \( y_1, y_2, y_3 \). We know \( y_i = x_i + \frac{a}{3} \) for \( i = 1, 2, 3 \). Using Vieta's formulas:
   \[
   y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = 0 
   \]
   and 
   \[
   y_1 y_2 y_3 = -\frac{1}{27}(2a^3 + 27c - 9ab).
   \]

3. **Utilize the conditions provided:**
   Using \( x_2 - x_1 = \lambda \):
   \[
   y_2 - y_1 = \left(x_2 + \frac{a}{3}\right) - \left(x_1 + \frac{a}{3}\right) = x_2 - x_1 = \lambda.
   \]
   And for \( x_3 \):
   \[
   y_3 = x_3 + \frac{a}{3} > \frac{1}{2}\left(x_1 + x_2\right) + \frac{a}{3} = \frac{1}{2}\left(y_1 + y_2\right) = -\frac{y_3}{2}.
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   y_3 > 0.
   \]

4. **Express \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) in terms of \( y_3 \) and \( \lambda \):**
   From the conditions:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = 0, \\
   y_2 - y_1 = \lambda,
   \end{cases}
   \]
   we solve:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   y_1 = -\frac{1}{2}(y_3 + \lambda), \\
   y_2 = -\frac{1}{2}(y_3 - \lambda).
   \end{cases}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( \frac{2a^3 + 27c - 9ab}{\lambda^3} \):**
   \[
   \frac{2a^3 + 27c - 9ab}{\lambda^3} = -\frac{27 y_1 y_2 y_3}{\lambda^3}.
   \]
   Substituting \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \):
   \[
   y_1 y_2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}(y_3 + \lambda)\right) \left(-\frac{1}{2}(y_3 - \lambda)\right) = \frac{1}{4}(y_3^2 - \lambda^2).
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \frac{2a^3 + 27c - 9ab}{\lambda^3} = -\frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{y_3^3 - y_3 \lambda^2}{\lambda^3} = -\frac{27}{4} \left(\frac{y_3}{\lambda}^3 - \frac{y_3}{\lambda} \right).
   \]

6. **Define \( z = \frac{y_3}{\lambda} \):**
   Then the expression becomes:
   \[
   -\frac{27}{4} \left(z^3 - z\right).
   \]

7. **Maximize \( g(z) = z^3 - z \) for \( z > 0 \):**
   \[
   g'(z) = 3z^2 - 1 \quad \text{and setting} \quad g'(z) = 0 \quad \text{gives} \quad z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]
   The function \( g(z) \) is strictly decreasing for \( z > \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \) and strictly increasing for \( 0 < z < \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \). Hence, the minimum value of \( g(z) \) is attained at \( z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \):
   \[
   g\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^3 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{9}.
   \]

8. **Compute the maximum value of the original expression:**
   \[
   \frac{2a^3 + 27c - 9ab}{\lambda^3} = -\frac{27}{4} \left(-\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{9}\right) = \frac{27 \times 2 \sqrt{3}}{4 \times 9} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}.

Prove that $DE \cdot DF = DA^2$.","1. **Identify Key Elements**: Consider \( \triangle ABC \) where \( CA = CB \) and \( D \) is the midpoint of \( AB \). Line \( \mathrm{EF} \) passes through \( D \) such that \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle \mathrm{EFC} \) share the same incircle (inscribed circle).

2. **Given Common Incircle**: Let the shared incircle of \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle \mathrm{EFC} \) be denoted by \( I \). 

3. **Excenter Involvement**: Assume that \( J \) is the \( C \)-excenter of \( \triangle ABC \). Thus, point \( J \) is also the \( C \)-excenter of \( \triangle \mathrm{EFC} \) because these two triangles share the same incircle.

4. **Properties of Excenters and Circumcenters**:
    - \( C, D, I, \) and \( J \) are collinear since \( D \) is the midpoint of \( AB \) and \( I \) is the incenter.
    - Because \( J \) is the excenter for both triangles at vertex \( C \), it lies on line \( \mathrm{CI} \).
    
5. **Midpoint Calculations**: Let \( \mathrm{K} \) be the midpoint of \( \mathrm{IJ} \). By properties of excircles and incenters in isosceles triangles:
    \[
    \mathrm{KI} = \mathrm{KJ} = K \text{A} = K \text{B} = K \text{E} = K \text{F}
    \]
    This relationship shows that all these points are equidistant to \( K \).

6. **Cyclic Hexagon Formation**: Hence, the points \( A, E, I, B, F, J \) form a cyclic hexagon because they lie on a common circle (i.e., they are concyclic).

7. **Power of a Point (for Point \( D \))**:
    - We apply the Power of a Point theorem at \( D \) for this cyclic hexagon:

The total liquid of 8 liters was poured out into a vessel of capacity 10 liters, and the rest of the vessel was filled with water. The new concentration of the mixture is 30.000000000000004%. What is the percentage of alcohol in the first vessel?","Let's denote the percentage of alcohol in the first vessel (2 liters) as x%.

From the second vessel (6 liters), we have 40% alcohol. This means that in the 6 liters, there is \(6 \text{ liters} \times 0.40 = 2.4 \text{ liters}\) of alcohol.

When both vessels are combined, we have a total of 8 liters of liquid. We are told that the new concentration of the mixture is 30.000000000000004%, which is essentially 30% (the extra decimal places are likely due to a rounding error or precision issue in the calculation).

The total amount of alcohol in the 8 liters at 30% concentration is \(8 \text{ liters} \times 0.30 = 2.4 \text{ liters}\).

Now, let's calculate the amount of alcohol that came from the first vessel. Since we already have 2.4 liters of alcohol from the second vessel, the first vessel must contribute the remaining alcohol to reach the 2.4 liters total in the 8-liter mixture.

Let's set up the equation:

\[
\text{Amount of alcohol from the first vessel} + \text{Amount of alcohol from the second vessel} = \text{Total amount of alcohol in the mixture}
\]

\[
(2 \text{ liters} \times \frac{x}{100}) + 2.4 \text{ liters} = 2.4 \text{ liters}
\]

Since the amount of alcohol from the second vessel is already 2.4 liters, the amount of alcohol from the first vessel must be 0 liters to maintain the total of 2.4 liters of alcohol in the mixture. This means that the first vessel contains 0% alcohol.

Therefore, the percentage of alcohol in the first vessel is $\boxed{0\%}$ .","[{'content': 'A vessel of capacity 2 liters has a certain percentage of alcohol and another vessel of capacity 6 liters has 40% alcohol.

we have $S_{n-1}=2^{n-1}a_{n-1}-1 (n \geqslant 2)$.
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
$a\_n=2^{n}a\_n-2^{n-1}a_{n-1} (n \geqslant 2)$.
Simplifying, we obtain:
$\frac{a\_n}{a_{n+1}}=\frac{2^{n+1}-1}{2^{n}}=2-\frac{1}{2^{n}}$.

\[ pqr + pqs + prs + qrs = k, \]
\[ pqrs = 4. \]

Applying AM-GM inequality for four numbers, we get:
\[ \frac{p + q + r + s}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{pqrs}. \]
Substituting the values from Vieta's relations:
\[ \frac{4}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{4}. \]
Thus, we have:

orca_math,"At its Grand Opening, the Guthrie Market distributed two different types of souvenirs. One type cost 20 cents each, and the other type cost a certain amount. One thousand souvenirs were distributed in all, and the cost of these souvenirs was 220 dollars. They distributed 400 of the souvenirs with the unknown cost. How much did this type of souvenir cost?","Let's denote the cost of the unknown souvenir as \( x \) dollars each.

We know that 400 souvenirs of the unknown type were distributed, so the total cost for these would be \( 400x \).

We also know that the other type of souvenir costs 20 cents each, which is \( 0.20 \) dollars. Since a total of 1000 souvenirs were distributed, and 400 were of the unknown type, there must have been \( 1000 - 400 = 600 \) souvenirs of the 20-cent type.

The total cost for the 20-cent souvenirs would then be \( 600 \times 0.20 = 120 \) dollars.

The total cost of all the souvenirs is given as 220 dollars. So, the cost of the unknown souvenirs plus the cost of the 20-cent souvenirs should equal 220 dollars.

Therefore, we have the equation:

\( 400x + 120 = 220 \)

Subtract 120 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\( 400x = 220 - 120 \)

\( 400x = 100 \)

Now, divide both sides by 400 to solve for \( x \):

\( x = \frac{100}{400} \)

\( x = \frac{1}{4} \)

\( x = 0.25 \)

So, the unknown type of souvenir cost $\boxed{25}$  cents each.","[{'content': 'At its Grand Opening, the Guthrie Market distributed two different types of souvenirs.

   \[ p = 2^{3009} = 2^{3 \times 1003} = (2^3)^{1003} = 8^{1003} \]

Given the quadratic equation:

\[
(a^3 + 1) x^2 + (a^2 + 1) x - (a + 1) = 0
\]

where \( a < -1 \).

1. **Identify the coefficients and analyze their signs:**

    - \( a^3 + 1 \)
    - \( a^2 + 1 \)
    - \( -(a+1) \)

2. **Signs of the coefficients under the condition \( a < -1 \):**

    - Since \( a < -1 \), we have \( a^3 < -1 \), therefore \( a^3 + 1 < 0 \).
    - Given \( a^2 \geq 0 \) and \( a^2 + 1 \geq 1 \), it follows that \( a^2 + 1 > 0 \).
    - Since \( a < -1 \), then \( a + 1 < 0 \).

3. **Discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of the quadratic equation:**

    The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \) is given by:

    \Delta = B^2 - 4AC
    \]

    Here \( A = a^3 + 1 \), \( B = a^2 + 1 \), and \( C = -(a + 1) \). Thus, the discriminant is:
    \[
    \Delta = (a^2 + 1)^2 - 4(a^3 + 1)(-(a + 1))
    \]

4. **Simplify the discriminant:**

    Substituting \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) into the discriminant formula:
    \[
    \Delta = (a^2 + 1)^2 + 4(a^3 + 1)(a + 1)
    \]

    Since \( a^3 + 1 < 0 \) and \( a + 1 < 0 \), their product is positive. Consequently, the discriminant \(\Delta > 0\), indicating:

    \[
    \Delta > 0

    Therefore, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

5. **Determine the nature of the roots using Vieta's formulas:**

    According to Vieta's formulas:

    - The product of the roots is given by:

    For our equation:
    \[
    x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{a^2 + 1}{a^3 + 1}
    \]
    \[
    x_1 x_2 = \frac{-(a + 1)}{a^3 + 1}
    \]

6. **Sign of the roots' product:**

    Given \( x_1 x_2 = \frac{-(a + 1)}{a^3 + 1} \) and because \( a + 1 < 0 \) and \( a^3 + 1 < 0 \):
    \[
    x_1 x_2 = \frac{-(a + 1)}{a^3 + 1} < 0
    \]

    This implies that the roots \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) have opposite signs.

7. **Sum of the roots:**

    Given \( x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{a^2 + 1}{a^3 + 1} \) with \(a^2 + 1 > 0 \) and \( a^3 + 1 < 0 \):
    \[
    x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{a^2 + 1}{a^3 + 1} > 0

If $QR = 2001$, $SU = 2002$, and $TV = 2003$, find the distance between the midpoints of $QU$ and $RV$.","To find the distance between the midpoints of $Q U$ and $R V$, let's break down the given information and analyze each step.

1. **Identify the midpoints**:
    - $Q$, $R$, $S$, $T$, $U$, $V$ are midpoints of segments $AB$, $AC$, $AD$, $BC$, $BD$, $CD$ respectively.

2. **Recall Midpoint theorem**:
    - The Midpoint Theorem states that the segment connecting the midpoints of any two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half as long.
    - Applying this theorem simplifies understanding the relationship and distances between these midpoints.

3. **Given distances**:
    - $Q R = 2001$
    - $S U = 2002$
    - $T V = 2003$

4. **Analyze quadrilateral $QUVR$**:
    - $Q R$ is parallel to $BC$ (because it's a segment joining midpoints of \(AB\) and \(AC\)).
    - $U V$ is also parallel to $BC$ (by a similar argument as $U$ and $V$ are midpoints of segments $BD$ and $CD$ respectively).
    - $Q U$ is parallel to $AD$, which is the segment joining midpoints of \(AB\) and \(BD\).
    - $R V$ is also parallel to $AD$ (as \(R\) and \(V\) are midpoints of \(AC\) and \(CD\)).

5. **Form of $QUVR$**:
    - The quadrilateral $QUVR$ is a parallelogram since opposite sides are both parallel and equal in length.

6. **Distance between midpoints $QU$ and $RV$**:
    - In a parallelogram, the midpoints of opposite sides form another parallelogram.
    - Since $QUVR$ is a parallelogram, the distance between the midpoints of $QU$ and $RV$ is the same as any side length of $QUVR$.
    - Hence, the distance between the midpoints of $QU$ and $RV$ is equal to $Q R$.

**Option A:**

1. Define $g(x)=f(x)+x=x\ln x+x$.
2. Calculate the derivative: $g'(x)=\ln x + 2$.
3. Analyze $g'(x)$:
   - When $0 < x < \frac{1}{e^2}$, we have $\ln x + 2 < 0$, so $g(x)$ is decreasing.
   - When $x > \frac{1}{e^2}$, we have $\ln x + 2 > 0$, so $g(x)$ is increasing.
4. Conclusion for option A:
   - If $0 < x_{1} < x_{2} < \frac{1}{e^2}$, then $g(x_{1}) > g(x_{2})$, which means $x_{1}+f(x_{1}) > x_{2}+f(x_{2})$. Thus, option A is $\boxed{\text{incorrect}}$.

**Option B:**

1. Consider the ratio $\frac{f(x)}{x}=\ln x$.
2. Since $\ln x$ is monotonically increasing for $x > 0$, if $0 < x_{1} < x_{2}$, then $\ln x_{1} < \ln x_{2}$.
3. Therefore, $\frac{f(x_{1})}{x_{1}} < \frac{f(x_{2})}{x_{2}}$, which implies $x_{2}f(x_{1}) < x_{1}f(x_{2})$. Thus, option B is $\boxed{\text{correct}}$.

**Option C:**

1. The derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x)=\ln x + 1$.
2. Analyze $f'(x)$:
   - When $0 < x < \frac{1}{e}$, $f'(x) < 0$, so $f(x)$ is decreasing.
   - When $x > \frac{1}{e}$, $f'(x) > 0$, so $f(x)$ is increasing.
3. For ${x_2} > {x_1} > \frac{1}{e}$, $f(x_{1}) < f(x_{2})$.
4. This leads to $(x_{1}-x_{2})f(x_{1}) > (x_{1}-x_{2})f(x_{2})$, which simplifies to $x_{1}f(x_{1})+x_{2}f(x_{2}) > x_{2}f(x_{1})+x_{1}f(x_{2})$. Thus, option C is $\boxed{\text{correct}}$.

$(1)$ According to the pattern of the above equations: $a=$______, $b=$______;  
$(2)$ Write down your conjecture for the $n$th equation (expressed in terms of $n$), and prove it.","### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Part 1: Finding $a$ and $b$

**Given Equations:**

1. $1^{2}+2^{2}-3^{2}=1\times a-b$
2. $2^{2}+3^{2}-4^{2}=2\times 0-b$
3. $3^{2}+4^{2}-5^{2}=3\times 1-b$
4. $4^{2}+5^{2}-6^{2}=4\times 2-b$

**For $a$:**

From the pattern, we observe that the coefficient of $a$ in the first equation is $1$. The left side of the equation simplifies to $1+4-9=-4$. Therefore, we have:

$-4 = 1 \times a - b$

Given that $b$ is a constant across all equations, we can deduce the value of $a$ by comparing the structure of the equations. The first part of the right side of the equation is the product of the index and the number $2$ less than the index. Thus, for the first equation, it should be $1 \times (-1) = -1$. Hence,

$a = -1$

**For $b$:**

From the second equation $2^{2}+3^{2}-4^{2}=2\times 0-b$, we calculate the left side:

$4 + 9 - 16 = -3$

This gives us:

$-3 = 2 \times 0 - b$

Solving for $b$, we find:

$b = 3$

Therefore, the values are:

$a = \boxed{-1}$, $b = \boxed{3}$

#### Part 2: Conjecture for the $n$th Equation and Proof

**Conjecture:**

The $n$th equation can be represented as:

$n^{2}+\left(n+1\right)^{2}-\left(n+2\right)^{2}=n\left(n-2\right)-3$

**Proof:**

**Left Side:**

Starting with the left side of the conjectured equation:

\begin{align*}
n^{2}+(n+1)^{2}-(n+2)^{2} &= n^{2}+(n^{2}+2n+1)-(n^{2}+4n+4) \\
&= n^{2}+n^{2}+2n+1-n^{2}-4n-4 \\
&= n^{2}-2n-3
\end{align*}

**Right Side:**

For the right side of the conjectured equation:

$n\left(n-2\right)-3 = n^{2}-2n-3$

Since the left side equals the right side, we have proven that:

$n^{2}+\left(n+1\right)^{2}-\left(n+2\right)^{2}=n\left(n-2\right)-3$

Therefore, the conjecture for the $n$th equation is proven and can be encapsulated as:

olympiads,"Given that \(1 \leq x, y, z \leq 6\), how many cases are there in which the product of natural numbers \(x, y, z\) is divisible by 10?","Given the constraints \(1 \leq x, y, z \leq 6\), we are to find the number of natural number combinations \((x, y, z)\) such that their product can be divided exactly by 10. 

To begin, we observe:
1. The total number of combinations of \(x, y, z\) is \(6^3\):
   \[
   6^3 = 216
   \]

2. To be divisible by 10, the product \(xyz\) must include both a factor of 2 and a factor of 5. Therefore, we need to evaluate the ways we can count combinations of \(x, y, z\) that miss these factors.

3. Consider the cases where \(x, y, z\) do not include factors of 2. The numbers within the range that are not multiples of 2 are \{1, 3, 5\}. The number of combinations in this case is:
   \[
   3^3 = 27
   \]

4. Next, consider the cases where \(x, y, z\) do not include factors of 5. The numbers within the range that are not multiples of 5 are \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}. The number of combinations in this case is:
   \[
   5^3 = 125
   \]

5. Now consider the cases where \(x, y, z\) include neither factors of 2 nor factors of 5. The only valid numbers in the range are then \{1, 3\}. The number of combinations in this case is:
   \[
   2^3 = 8
   \]

6. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can calculate the number of combinations where \(xyz\) is not divisible by 10:
   \[
   |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
   \]
   where \(A\) is the set of combinations not including any multiples of 2 (27 in total) and \(B\) is the set not including any multiples of 5 (125 in total), and \(|A \cap B| = 8\):

   \[
   |A \cup B| = 27 + 125 - 8 = 144
   \]

7. Therefore, the number of combinations where \(xyz\) is divisible by 10 is:
   \[
   6^3 - |A \cup B| = 216 - 144 = 72

3. Let \( d \) be a divisor of \( a_n \) that does not appear in any of the sequences \( a \) and \( b \) up to \( a_n \) and \( b_{n-1} \).
  
4. Let \( x \) be the smallest positive integer that does not appear in any of the sequences \( a \) and \( b \).

5. To ensure \( x \) appears as \( b_{n+2} \), we follow the following constructions:
   
   1. Represent the prime factorization: 
      \[
      d = \prod p_i^{c_i}, \quad a_n = \prod p_i^{e_i}, \quad \text{and} \quad x = \prod p_i^{f_i}.
      \]
   
   2. A situation may arise where \( e_i > c_i \). Hence, ensure \( f_i \leq c_i \).
   
   3. Select new primes \( p_{j_1} \) and \( p_{j_2} \) such that \( p_{j_1} \) and \( p_{j_2} \) are not dividers of any terms in \( a \) and \( b \).

6. Construct:
   \[
   \begin{array}{cccccc}
   a_{n} & & a_{n+1} & & a_{n+2} & \\
   & b_{n} & & b_{n+1} & & a_{n+3} \\
   & & b_{n+2} &
   \end{array}
   \]
   
7. Choose \( \varepsilon_i = 0 \) for all \( i \neq j_{1}, j_{2} \); use a very large prime \( q \) to ensure a unique prime divisor for the next terms.

8. Ensure that:
   \[
   a_{n+3} = q \cdot \text{(some value ensuring unique new prime factors)}
   \]

Following these steps ensures that every positive integer appears exactly once in the sequences \( \left(a_n\right) \) and \( \left(b_n\right) \). This concludes the construction algorithm and verification.

Casey will be staying 3 months, each with exactly 4 weeks. She saves $360 by paying monthly. What is the weekly charge for the motel?","Let's denote the weekly charge for the motel as W dollars.

Casey is staying for 3 months, and each month has exactly 4 weeks. So, she would be staying for a total of 3 months * 4 weeks/month = 12 weeks.

If she were to pay weekly, her total cost would be 12 weeks * W dollars/week.

However, she is given the option to pay monthly at a rate of $1000/month. Since she is staying for 3 months, her total cost for paying monthly would be 3 months * $1000/month = $3000.

We are told that by paying monthly, Casey saves $360. This means that the total cost of paying weekly is $360 more than the total cost of paying monthly.

So, we can set up the following equation:

12W (total cost if paying weekly) = $3000 (total cost if paying monthly) + $360 (savings by paying monthly)

Now we can solve for W:

12W = $3000 + $360
12W = $3360

Divide both sides by 12 to find the weekly charge:

W = $3360 / 12
W = $280

Therefore, the weekly charge for the motel is $\boxed{\$280}$ .","[{'content': 'Casey is going to stay at a motel while she works her summer job as a ski instructor.

This product is also known as 35 factorial, denoted as \( 35! \).

We can count the number of factors of 3 in \( 35! \) by dividing 35 by 3 and considering the quotient, then dividing the quotient by 3 again, and so on, until the quotient is less than 3. This process accounts for the fact that some numbers may have more than one factor of 3 (for example, 9 has two factors of 3, since \( 9 = 3^2 \)).

Let's perform the calculations:

1. \( \lfloor \frac{35}{3} \rfloor = 11 \) (This gives us the count of numbers that are multiples of 3 up to 35.)
2. \( \lfloor \frac{11}{3} \rfloor = 3 \) (This gives us the count of numbers that are multiples of 9, since each of these contributes an additional factor of 3.)
3. \( \lfloor \frac{3}{3} \rfloor = 1 \) (This gives us the count of numbers that are multiples of 27, since 27 contributes two additional factors of 3, but we've already counted one of them in the first step.)

Now, we add up all the quotients to get the total number of factors of 3 in \( 35! \):

$(1)$ If $a\geqslant 0$, the maximum value of the function $f(x)$ is $\frac{3}{e}$, find the value of the real number $a$;

$(2)$ If for any $a\leqslant 0$, $f(x)\leqslant b\ln(x+1)$ holds true for all $x\in [0,+\infty)$, find the range of the real number $b$.","Solution:

$(1)$ According to the problem, $f'(x)=(2ax+1)e^{-x}-(ax^2+x+a)e^{-x}=-e^{-x}[ax^2+(1-2a)x+a-1]$

$=-e^{-x}(x-1)(ax+1-a)$,

$(i)$ When $a=0$, $f'(x)=-e^{-x}(x-1)$,

Let $f'(x) > 0$, we get $x < 1$; Let $f'(x) < 0$, we get $x > 1$,

Thus, $f(x)$ is increasing on $(-\infty,1)$ and decreasing on $(1,+\infty)$,

So, the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $f(1)= \frac{1}{e}\neq \frac{3}{e}$, which does not meet the condition,

$(ii)$ When $a > 0$, $1- \frac{1}{a} < 1$, Let $f'(x) > 0$, we get $1- \frac{1}{a} < x < 1$,

Let $f'(x) < 0$, we get $x < 1- \frac{1}{a}$ or $x > 1$,

Thus, $f(x)$ is increasing on $(1- \frac{1}{a},1)$, decreasing on $(-\infty,1- \frac{1}{a})$ and $(1,+\infty)$,

So, the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $f(1)= \frac{2a+1}{e}= \frac{3}{e}$,

We get $a=1$,

In summary, $\boxed{a=1}$.

$(2)$ Let $g(a)=e^{-x}(x^2+x)a+xe^{-x}, a\in(-\infty,0]$, 

When $x\in[0,+\infty)$, $e^{-x}(x^2+x)\geqslant 0$,

Then $g(a)\leqslant b\ln(x+1)$ for all $a\in(-\infty,0]$ is equivalent to $g(a)\leqslant g(0)\leqslant b\ln(x+1)$,

That is, $xe^{-x}\leqslant b\ln(x+1)$ for all $x\in[0,+\infty)$,

$(i)$ When $b\leqslant 0$, for all $x\in(0,+\infty)$, $b\ln(x+1) < 0$, $xe^{-x} > 0$, at this time $xe^{-x} > b\ln(x+1)$,

Which does not meet the condition,

$(ii)$ When $b > 0$, let $h(x)=b\ln(x+1)-xe^{-x}$, $x\in[0,+\infty)$,

Then $h'(x)= \frac{b}{x+1}-(e^{-x}-xe^{-x})= \frac{be^x+x^2-1}{(x+1)e^x}$, where $(x+1)e^x > 0$, for all $x\in[0,+\infty)$,

Let $p(x)=be^x+x^2-1$, $x\in[0,+\infty)$, then $p(x)$ is increasing on the interval $[0,+\infty)$,

$(1)$ When $b\geqslant 1$, $p(x)\geqslant p(0)=b-1\geqslant 0$,

So for all $x\in[0,+\infty)$, $h'(x)\geqslant 0$, thus $h(x)$ is increasing on $[0,+\infty)$,

So for all $x\in[0,+\infty)$, $h(x)\geqslant h(0)=0$,

That is, the inequality $xe^{-x}\leqslant b\ln(x+1)$ holds true for all $x\in[0,+\infty)$,

$(2)$ When $0 < b < 1$, since $p(0)=b-1 < 0$, $p(1)=be > 0$ and $p(x)$ is increasing on the interval $[0,+\infty)$,

There exists a unique $x_0\in(0,1)$ such that $p(x_0)=0$, and when $x\in(0,x_0)$, $h'(x) < 0$,

Given the problem:
> Prove that for each \( n \geq 2 \), there is a set \( S \) of \( n \) integers such that \( (a-b)^2 \) divides \( ab \) for every distinct \( a, b \in S \).

We aim to show that such a set \( S \) exists for all \( n \geq 2 \). To do this, we rely on the direct corollary of a more general result proved in the USA TST 2015 problem. The more general problem states:

> Prove that for every positive integer \( n \), there exists a set \( S \) of \( n \) positive integers such that for any two distinct \( a, b \in S \), \( a - b \) divides \( a \) and \( b \) but not any other element of \( S \).

To utilize this theorem, let's recall the problem statement from the USA TST 2015:

1. For any \( n \geq 2 \), there exists a set \( S \) of \( n \) positive integers.
2. Each pair of distinct elements \( a, b \) in this set satisfies the condition that \( a - b \) divides both \( a \) and \( b \).

Based on the USA TST 2015 problem, consider the specific construction: 
- Let \( S = \{ k, k(k + 1), k(k + 1)(k + 2), \dots, k(k + 1)(k + 2) \ldots (k + n - 1) \} \)
- Here, \( k \) is a positive integer.

We need to verify that for any distinct \( a, b \in S \):
- \( (a - b)^2 \) divides \( ab \).

By the construction, each element of the set \( S \) looks like a product of consecutive integers starting from \( k \). Thus, for any two distinct elements \( a, b \) in the set \( S \):

- Let \( a = k(k + 1)\ldots(k + i) \) and \( b = k (k + 1)\ldots (k + j) \) where \( i \neq j \).
- Without loss of generality, suppose \( i < j \). So \( b = a(k+i+1)(k+i+2)\ldots(k+j) \).

The difference \( a - b \) would involve subtracting two such products where one is a subset of the factors of the other.

Now consider \( (a - b)^2 \):
- Since \( b \) can be expressed in terms of \( a \), \( b = a \times (\text{product of additional consecutive integers}) \).
- Therefore, \( a - b \) is \( a \) times (additional factors minus 1), ensuring \( a - b \) is symmetric in the factor \( a \).
  
This symmetry ensures:
- If \( a - b \) is significantly factored compared to \( a \) and \( b \), then \( (a - b)^2 \) can fit as a divisor of the product \( ab \).

Thus, \( (a-b)^2 \) will divide \( ab \) by this careful selection and inherent symmetry their product restructuring provides.

In conclusion, by using the construction provided by USA TST 2015's criteria in the particular form of choosing elements that follow the first product of consecutive integers, we ensure that the set \( S \) satisfies the given condition for \( n \geq 2 \).

synthetic_math,"Solve the inequality
\[ -8x^2 + 6x - 1 < 0. \]","Firstly, find the discriminant of the quadratic equation \(-8x^2 + 6x - 1 = 0\):
\[
\Delta = 6^2 - 4(-8)(-1) = 36 - 32 = 4.
\]
Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 4\) is positive, there are two real roots, which means the quadratic will change signs at its roots.

Next, calculate the roots of the quadratic using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{4}}{2(-8)} = \frac{-6 \pm 2}{-16} = \frac{-4}{-16}, \frac{-8}{-16} = 0.25, 0.5.
\]
Since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is \(-8\), the parabola is downward facing, and thus the inequality \(-8x^2 + 6x - 1 < 0\) is true between the roots \(0.25\) and \(0.5\).

Conclusion:
The solution of the inequality \(-8x^2 + 6x - 1 < 0\) is the interval in which the quadratic expression is negative, i.e., between its roots.

How long in miles is Jason's commute to work with this detour?","First, let's calculate the distance between the second store and the third store without the detour. Since this distance is 2/3rds longer than the distance between the first two stores, we can calculate it as follows:

Distance between second and third store = Distance between first and second store + (2/3 * Distance between first and second store)
Distance between second and third store = 6 miles + (2/3 * 6 miles)
Distance between second and third store = 6 miles + 4 miles
Distance between second and third store = 10 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance of Jason's commute without the detour:

Distance from house to first store = 4 miles
Distance between first and second store = 6 miles
Distance between second and third store = 10 miles
Distance from third store to work = 4 miles

Total commute without detour = 4 miles + 6 miles + 10 miles + 4 miles
Total commute without detour = 24 miles

With the detour, the distance between the second and third store increases by 3 miles:

Detour distance = Distance between second and third store + 3 miles
Detour distance = 10 miles + 3 miles
Detour distance = 13 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance of Jason's commute with the detour:

  - In both cases, there is no integer \( a > 1 \) such that \( a^2 \mid 1 \) or \( a^2 \mid 2 \).

- For \( p = 7 \):
  - Primes \( q < 7 \) are 2, 3, and 5.
  - \( 7 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 \), and \( 7 = 1 \cdot 5 + 2 \).
  - The remainders are \( r = 1 \) and \( r = 2 \), and in both cases, there is no integer \( a > 1 \) such that \( a^2 \mid r \).

**Step 3:** Consider \( p = 11 \):

- Primes \( q < 11 \) are 2, 3, 5, 7.
  - For \( q = 2 \), \( 11 = 5 \cdot 2 + 1 \).
  - For \( q = 3 \), \( 11 = 3 \cdot 3 + 2 \).
  - For \( q = 5 \), \( 11 = 2 \cdot 5 + 1 \).
  - For \( q = 7 \), \( 11 = 1 \cdot 7 + 4 \).

  However, since \( 4 = 2^2 \), there is an integer \( a = 2 \) such that \( a^2 \mid 4 \). Thus, \( p = 11 \) does **not** satisfy the condition.

**Step 4:** Investigate \( p > 11 \):

- If \( p > 11 \), the remaining possible remainders \( r \) for \( p \) when divided by a prime \( q \) (where \( q < p \)) are:

  \[ r \neq 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 \]

  Now, considering \( p \) of the forms \( p - 4 \), \( p - 8 \), and \( p - 9 \):

  - Study \( p - 4 \):
    - \( p - 4 \) cannot include any prime factors greater than 3.
    - Suppose \( p - 4 = 3^a \geq 2 \).

  - Study \( p - 9 \):
    - \( p - 9 \) contains the prime factor 2 and possibly 7.
    - Let \( p - 9 = 3^a - 5 \).

**Step 5:** Detailed examination for valid \( p \):

- If \( p = 13 \):
  - Verify calculations:
    - \( p - 8 = 5 \), so \( p - 8 = 5^c \).

  - No contradictions and meets conditions for:
    - \( c = 1 \)

  Since:

  \[ p + 9 = 2 \cdot 7^0 + 1 \]
  
  Which meets given constraints:
    - \( p = 13 \).

**Conclusion:** 

The complete set of primes that satisfy the problem's conditions:

((x^some_power) - (x^8)) / ((x^8) + (x^4)) = a

We want to find the units digit for a / (x^4). Let's first simplify the expression for a:

a = ((x^some_power) - (x^8)) / ((x^8) + (x^4))

Now, let's divide both sides by (x^4):

a / (x^4) = ((x^some_power) / (x^4) - (x^8) / (x^4)) / ((x^8) / (x^4) + 1)

Simplify the right side:

a / (x^4) = (x^(some_power - 4) - x^4) / (x^4 + 1)

We know that the units digit of a / (x^4) is 9. The units digit of x^4 is the same as the units digit of (13!)^4. Since 13! is a large number ending with a units digit of 0 (because it includes the factors 10, 11, 12, and 13, which ensure that the product will have at least two trailing zeros), raising it to any power will still result in a number ending with 0. Therefore, the units digit of x^4 is 0.

Now, we have:

a / (x^4) = (x^(some_power - 4) - 0) / (0 + 1)

This simplifies to:

a / (x^4) = x^(some_power - 4)

Since the units digit of a / (x^4) is 9 and we know that x^(some_power - 4) must also end in 9, we need to find a power of 10 that ends in 9. However, no power of 10 will ever end in 9 because any power of 10 will always end in 0.

According to the information given, 20% of the students are bringing their own life vests. This means that 80% of the students will need life vests provided by Alice.

We also know that there are 10 instructors, including Alice, and they will need life vests too. So, the number of life vests needed for the instructors is 10.

Therefore, the number of life vests needed for the students is 42 (total needed) - 10 (for instructors) = 32 life vests for the students.

Since 80% of the students need life vests, we can set up the equation:

\[ 
f(y-f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(f(y)) 
\]","
Nous voulons trouver toutes les fonctions \( f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) qui satisfont l'équation fonctionnelle suivante pour tous \( x, y \in \mathbb{R} \):

\[
f(y - f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(f(y))
\]

1. **Injectivité de \( f \)**:
    
    Pour prouver que \( f \) est injective, supposons que \( f(a) = f(b) \). Nous allons montrer que cela implique \( a = b \).

    Écrivons l'équation fonctionnelle pour \( x = a \) et \( x = b \):

    \[
    f(y - f(a)) = f(a) - 2a + f(f(y))
    \]

    \[
    f(y - f(b)) = f(b) - 2b + f(f(y))
    \]

    Puisque \( f(a) = f(b) \), nous avons:

    \[
    f(y - f(a)) = f(a) - 2a + f(f(y)) = f(b) - 2b + f(f(y)) = f(y - f(b))
    \]

    En comparant les deux équations, nous obtenons:

    \[
    f(a) - 2a = f(b) - 2b
    \]

    Donc,

    \[
    2a = 2b \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = b
    \]

    Donc, \( f \) est injective.

2. **Établir \( f(0) = 0 \)**:

    Supposons \( x = 0 \) et \( y = f(0) \) dans l'équation fonctionnelle:

    \[
    f(f(0) - f(0)) = f(0) - 2 \cdot 0 + f(f(f(0)))
    \]

    Simplifions cette expression:

    \[
    f(0) = f(0) + f(f(f(0)))
    \]

    \[
    f(f(f(0))) = 0
    \]

    Prenons maintenant \( x = f(f(0)) \) et \( y = 0 \):

    \[
    f(0 - f(f(f(0)))) = f(f(f(0))) - 2f(f(0)) + f(f(0))
    \]

    Nous savons que \( f(f(f(0))) = 0 \), donc ceci se simplifie à:

    \[
    f(0) = 0 - 2f(f(0)) + f(f(0))
    \]

    \[
    f(f(0)) = -2f(f(0))
    \]

    \[
    3f(f(0)) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f(f(0)) = 0
    \]

    Appliquons \( f \) des deux côtés:

    \[
    f(f(f(0))) = f(0)
    \]

    Comme nous avions déjà \( f(f(f(0))) = 0 \), nous obtenons:

    \[
    f(0) = 0
    \]

3. **Prouver \( f(y) = y \)**:
    
    Suppléons \( x = 0 \) dans l'équation initiale:

    \[
    f(y - f(0)) = f(0) - 2 \cdot 0 + f(f(y))
    \]

    Puisque \( f(0) = 0 \):

    \[
    f(y) = f(f(y))
    \]

    Par injectivité de \( f \), cela signifie que:

    \[
    y = f(y)
    \]

    Nous devons vérifier que \( f(y) = y \) est bien une solution de l'équation fonctionnelle:

    Remplaçons \( f(y) = y \) dans l'équation:

    \[
    f(y - f(x)) = f(x) - 2x + f(f(y))
    \]

    LHS:

    \[
    f(y - x) = y - x
    \]

    RHS:

    \[
    x - 2x + y = y - x
    \]

    Les deux côtés sont égaux, donc \( f(y) = y \) satisfait bien l'équation fonctionnelle.

**Conclusion**:
Les seules fonctions \( f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) qui satisfont l'équation fonctionnelle donnée sont les fonctions d'identité.

The equation of the hyperbola $C_{2}: x^{2}-y^{2}=4$ can be rewritten as $\dfrac {x^{2}}{4}- \dfrac {y^{2}}{4}=1$.

Since $|PF_{1}|-|PF_{2}|=4$, we have $|PF_{1}|=6$. Therefore, $c= \sqrt {4+4}=2 \sqrt {2}$, which means $c=2 \sqrt {2}$.

By the definition of an ellipse, we have $2a=|PF_{2}|+|PF_{2}|=8$,

Thus, $a=4$.

The eccentricity of the ellipse $C_{1}$ is $e= \dfrac {c}{a}= \dfrac { \sqrt {2}}{2}$.

   - Length-wise, each part is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) units.
   - Width-wise, each part is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) units.

Consider four-digit numbers in the form $abcd$.

1. **Odd-Odd Combinations**:
   - There are 5 choices each for the first and the third digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), making $5 \times 5 = 25$ odd-odd combinations.
   - The second digit, being the average, will be odd. For each chosen pair $(a, c)$, there is exactly one valid $b$.
   - Each of the last digits (d) has 10 possible values (0 through 9).

   Total odd-odd combinations = $25 \times 10 = 250$.

2. **Even-Even Combinations**:
   - The first and third digits must be chosen from 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (excluding zero as the first digit) leading to $4 \times 4 = 16$ combinations.
   - Each valid pair $(a, c)$ gives exactly one possible value for $b$ which is even.

math,"Find all real numbers $x$ so that the product $(x + i)((x + 1) + i)((x + 2) + i)$ is pure imaginary.  Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.","To find all real numbers $x$ such that the product $(x + i)((x + 1) + i)((x + 2) + i)$ is pure imaginary, we start by expanding the given expression step by step:

First, expand the first two factors:
\begin{align*}
(x + i)((x + 1) + i) &= x(x + 1) + xi + (x + 1)i + i^2 \\
&= x^2 + x + xi + (x + 1)i - 1 \\
&= x^2 + x - 1 + (x + x + 1)i \\
&= x^2 + x - 1 + (2x + 1)i.
\end{align*}

Next, multiply this result by the third factor:
\begin{align*}
(x^2 + x - 1 + (2x + 1)i)((x + 2) + i) &= (x^2 + x - 1)(x + 2) + (x^2 + x - 1)i + (2x + 1)(x + 2)i + (2x + 1)i^2 \\
&= x^3 + 2x^2 + x^2 + 2x - x - 2 + (x^2 + x - 1)i + (2x^2 + 4x + 2x + 4)i - (2x + 1) \\
&= x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 3 + (3x^2 + 6x + 1)i.
\end{align*}

For the product to be pure imaginary, the real part must be zero. Therefore, we set the real part equal to zero and solve for $x$:
\begin{align*}
x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 3 &= 0 \\
(x + 3)(x + 1)(x - 1) &= 0.

- Provide a labeling that satisfies these conditions.
- Show that in all such labelings the same number appears in the topmost field.
- How many such labelings exist in total? (Two labelings are different if they differ in at least one field.)","
1. Let's denote the numbers in the fields of the figure as follows:

   ![Figure](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_96cf05b4155531978f40g-4.jpg?height=388&width=1282&top_left_y=654&top_left_x=387)

2. If we denote the common value of the six sums by \( s \), we obtain the following equations from the problem statement:

\[
\begin{aligned}
    a + b + f &= s, \\
    a + c + g &= s, \\
    a + d + h &= s, \\
    a + e + i &= s, \\
    b + c + d + e &= s, \\
    f + g + h + i &= s.
\end{aligned}
\]

From the fact that the sum of all the numbers, \(1+2+\ldots+9\) is 45, we also have:

\[
a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 45.
\]

3. Adding equations (1) through (4) and subtracting equations (5) and (6), we get:

\[
(a + b + f) + (a + c + g) + (a + d + h) + (a + e + i) = 4a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 4a + 45,
\]

Substituting the total sum (45) of all numbers, we have:

\[
4a + (a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i - a) = 4a + 45 - a = 3a + 45.
\]

From equations (5) and (6):

\[
b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = s + s - s = 2s.
\]

Combining these, we have:

\[
3a + 45 = 2s.
\]

4. Solving for \(a\):

\[
3a = 2s - 45 \Rightarrow a = \frac{2s - 45}{3}.
\]

5. Adding equations (5) and (6):

\[
(b + c + d + e) + (f + g + h + i) = s + s = 2s.
\]

Using \(a + s = 45\), we express \(s\):

\[
a + s = 45 \Rightarrow s = 45 - a.
\]

Substitute \(s\) back in our equation:

\[
3a + 45 = 2(45 - a) \Rightarrow 3a + 45 = 90 - 2a \Rightarrow 5a = 45 \Rightarrow a = 9.
\]

Thus, \(s = 18\). We confirm this by substituting \(a\):

\[
s = 2 \cdot 9 = 18.
\]

The equations now become:

\[
\begin{cases}
b + f = 9, \\
c + g = 9, \\
d + h = 9, \\
e + i = 9, \\
b + c + d + e = 18, \\
f + g + h + i = 18.
\end{cases}
\]

6. From the above configuration, we see we need to form pairs \(\{b, f\}, \{c, g\}, \{d, h\}, \{e, i\} = \{1,8\}, \{2,7\}, \{3,6\}, \{4,5\}\):

Try solutions \(\{b, f\} = \{1, 8\}\), \(\{c, g\} = \{2, 7\}\), \(\{d, h\} = \{3, 6\}\), \(\{e, i\} = \{4, 5\}\):

Checking values within these pairs:
\[
(b = 1, f = 8) \text{ or } (b = 8, f = 1), \\
(c = 2, g = 7) \text{ or } (c = 7, g = 2), \\
(d = 3, h = 6) \text{ or } (d = 6, h = 3), \\
(e = 4, i = 5) \text{ or } (e = 5, i = 4).
\]

Verifying combinations of pairs to satisfy \( s = 18 \):

\[
\{1,8\}, \{2,7\}, \{3,6\}, \{4,5\}.
\]

This results in combinations:

\((a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i)\):
\[
= (9, 1, 7, 6, 4, 8, 2, 3, 5), \\
= (9, 8, 2, 3, 5, 1, 7, 6, 4), \\
\]

This leads to the following labeling validations.

When $n=1$, we have $a\_1 = 1$.

For $n \geq 2$, we have $S\_{n-1} = 2a\_{n-1} - n + 1$.

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $a\_n = 2a\_{n-1} + 1$.

Therefore, $a\_n + 1 = 2(a\_{n-1} + 1)$.

This means that $\frac{a\_n + 1}{a\_{n-1} + 1} = 2$, which is a constant.

Thus, the sequence ${a\_n + 1}$ is a geometric sequence with first term $a\_1 + 1 = 2$ and common ratio $2$.

Hence, $a\_n + 1 = 2 \cdot 2^{n-1}$.

Solving for $a\_n$, we get $a\_n = 2^n - 1$.

Now, we need to find the maximum value of $n$ that satisfies $a\_n \leq 10n$.

Substituting $a\_n$ into the inequality, we get $2^n - 1 \leq 10n$.

Solving this inequality, we find that $n \leq 5$.

Therefore, the maximum value of $n$ that satisfies $a\_n \leq 10n$ is $\boxed{5}$.
